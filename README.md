# Electrum

*Electrum* is a formal specification framework, inspired by [Alloy](alloy.mit.edu) and [TLA+](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tla.html), tailored for the lightweight specification and analysis of  dynamic systems with rich configurations, developed by members of [HASLab](haslab.pt) and [ONERA](http://www.onera.fr/en). Electrum is supported by two model-checking techniques, one bounded based on the Alloy Analyzer, and the other unbounded built over the [nuXmv](https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/) model checker, to verify systems expressed in such language.
